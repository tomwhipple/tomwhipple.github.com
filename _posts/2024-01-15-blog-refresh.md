title: Blog Refresh
---
I've finally gotten around to refreshing this blog. It's a fresh start, since prior posts are now quite old (maybe more than a decade?), and probably not relevant anymore.  

It now uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the static generator. Previously it used [Octopress](http://octopress.org), but since that's built on Jekyll, it seems like added complexity, and Octopress seems not to be under active development anymore.
