title: Blog Refresh
---
I've finally gotten around to refreshing this blog. It's a fresh start, since prior posts are now quite old (almost a decade?) and probably not relevant anymore.

It now uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the static generator. Previously it used [Octopress](http://octopress.org), but since that's built on Jekyll, it seems like added complexity, and Octopress seems not to be under active development anymore.

The site [(source code)](https://github.com/tomwhipple/tomwhipple.github.com) is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Old-school social media

Hosting my own blog is more than just an early 2000's nostalgia trip; it means that there's no platform owner who will start requiring readers to sign up or ambush viewers with other popups halfway down the page. And, of course, I own the content.

## 100% human authored, original content

Everything here is written by me, Tom Whipple, a genuine human. :)
