I'm a widely experienced software engineering leader looking for remote or hybrid opportunities near Boulder CO, USA.

Summary
-------

I've built software my entire life. I've worked on networking infrastructure, solar electric vehicle control, airborne RF systems, a computer vision SDK for mobile apps, payment processing for billions of dollars in transactions, moved money onto the blockchain, and more. That's meant that I've had to learn new technologies quickly as well as understand how to how to work well with people, including leading multiple teams, communicating effectively with executives at large enterprises, or consulting individually to small business customers.

- Collaborated across the company to drive reduction of API errors and lower spurious declines.
- Grew a team of 4-5 engineers into a larger organization of 20 with external hiring and attracting talent from within the company.
- Developed and launched a new GraphQL API.

This meant that I personally:

### Principal Software Engineer, [card.io](https://github.com/card-io/)

#### July 2011 - July 2012

card.io was the first mobile computer vision solution to allow credit card entry by camera. It was acquired by PayPal in 2012, and open-sourced later that year. Although the product hasn't been supported for many years, it continues to be used by major brands today.

I served as the technical lead for the Android SDK and fraud control efforts as well as making contributions to the computer vision backend and iOS SDK, using Java, Objective-C and Python.
