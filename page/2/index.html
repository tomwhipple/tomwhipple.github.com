  <div class="entry-content">Today brought a lot of technical details which were important but very boring to the casual audience. I spent a good chunk of time in the iPhone lab, talking to Apple engineers and others while fixing bugs in our app. Plus, one of the sessions gave me a bunch of ideas to improve the performance and look of the app. Hopefully we can start getting them approved very soon!

The highlight of the day from a theatrical perspective was the lunchtime talk given by Dr. Ge Wang, CTO of <a href="http://www.smule.com/">Smule</a>. The apps produced by Smule are audio related, from the sonic lighter (a flame that you can blow out by blowing on the iPhone microphone) to various instruments that are played by pressing various &#8220;holes&#8221; or sliders on the iPhone screen and blowing into the microphone. There are a lot of other neat features, like being able to hear &amp; see music played by others across the world, but I won&#8217;t go into all the details.

The interesting part of this story is that in less than a year, one of their apps was downloaded over one million times. At $0.99 each, less 30% to Apple, that works out to be $700,000 from a single app. Not too bad for a company that didn&#8217;t exist a year ago. So, it seems clear that if you can produce a compelling app, there is money to be made. The question is then what makes a compelling app. Clearly a flame that &#8220;burns&#8221; on the screen has no useful value, yet many people paid for it. Of course most in the audience were no doubt thinking along the same line.

Nonetheless, we were treated to a performance by the Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra (or MoPho). It was &#8230; interesting. I took some photos, but they are unbelievably bad. Perhaps if I had an iPhone 3GS they would have turned out.

  <div class="entry-content">Today, I attended a session on networking and a couple of game overview sessions. The networking session was interesting, though not in a way that any non-developers would care about. The games sessions were interesting, since I haven&#8217;t done much in the way of game development in the past, though this may change.

The capabilities of the new OS, especially with the new hardware are absolutely fantastic. We&#8217;ve had accelerometer control since forever, which is just neat. Now, we add peer to peer gaming via bluetooth or WiFi so that users can have multi-player games across the room or across the world. The new phone adds a GPU, allowing amazing video effects. The addition of OpenAL means that 3D sound can be part of the game experience as well. (There&#8217;s also a magnetometer/compass, though it isn&#8217;t clear how that helps game development, but I&#8217;m sure someone will do something cool with it.) In one of the sessions yesterday it was mentioned that a high percentage of the apps up on the App Store are games. It is clear that Apple recognizes that the iPhone is not just a smart phone, but is poised to become a leading mobile game platform as well.

In many of the sessions, I find myself pulling out my iPhone or MacBook to jot down another idea for an application or product. Apple has provided developers with a lot of tools to express their creativity without having to keep track of minor details. It makes the idea of going back to the day job even more depressing, since I know that my employer has no incentive or motivation to explore these technologies, even though they could be tremendously useful. (No doubt there will be a post on this topic at some point in the future, though probably not soon.)

On an unrelated note, I was able to fix a serious bug in an app I have in development after talking to some of the Apple engineers in a lab. And, we don&#8217;t even have to mandate 3.0 for our users as I first feared. Now, I just have to re-submit the fixed version and then off to find a party&#8230;

  <div class="entry-content">Well, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen so many geeks in one place. Not even engineering school! As I write this I am sitting on the second floor of the Moscone convention center watching a couple hundred guys (oh and I can see 4 women &#8211; wait there&#8217;s another!) with their Macs out, posting on their blogs. (Yep, that includes me.)

The morning got off to a disappointing start when arrived to find the line wrapped all the way around the block. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t start moving until about 5 minutes before the keynote started, which meant that those of us that didn&#8217;t arrive at some obscene hour of the morning didn&#8217;t get seated in an overflow room until about 15 minutes in. We missed the launch of a couple of new Macs, but web feeds indicated it wasn&#8217;t anything too revolutionary - just the latest laptop lineup. I talked to a guy who started lining up at 3am(!!), so maybe the overflow room isn&#8217;t so bad.

We first learned about the new version of OSX (code name: Snow Leopard). It looks like there are going to be a lot of nifty enhancements to the UI in the Finder, Preview, Safari, and Quicktime. The case for the new Safari was particularly compelling if the claims about page rendering performance hold up. Since it will ship today, I&#8217;ll probably switch back from Firefox and see how it goes.

However the OS enhancements that look like they may be the most exciting for developers are the features related to multi-threading, multi-core, 64 bit support, and most interesting, the announcement of what Apple is calling OpenCL. This is a new <em>open</em> standard that Apple is releasing to the community, which is designed to allow non-graphics applications to use the GPU for their computations. This will be huge for scientific computing (hopefully Matlab) as well as programs like Photoshop. It will be interesting to see how Apple applies this technology to the MacBook Air, which has no GPU. Unfortunately, very few details were given for these features. Maybe we will learn more in this afternoon&#8217;s sessions.

The last part of the Keynote was about the reason I&#8217;m here: The iPhone. There are many new neat features that will open up a huge number of possibilities for all of us here. Some of the highlights are: peer to peer via bluetooth, opening up support for accessory hardware, and support sharing the cell network to your laptop and MMS support, pending carrier support. But, unlike the rest of the carriers in the world, it turns out that AT&amp;T won&#8217;t be supporting these technologies right away. This revelation drew laughs and heckles from the crowd. I sincerely hope that someone from AT&amp;T was in the room to hear it, since I&#8217;m pretty sure that most of us would drop our AT&amp;T contract in a second if there was another US carrier that supported the iPhone.

Finally, a new model of the iPhone was introduced. The new phone will have a faster processor, better camera and voice recognition. Of course everyone (including me) will want the new one, so I&#8217;m wondering who I can sell my current 16GB iPhone 3G to. It was also announced that the price of the current 4GB iPhone 3G would drop to $99.

<em> AFTERNOON UPDATE:  </em>The only way to describe the new developer tools: kick ass. The static analysis tools are revolutionary; the software can automatically find bugs like memory leaks and even logic errors without even running the code. This is amazing, both in terms of technology and ease of use. I can&#8217;t wait to try it.

  <div class="entry-content"><em>UPDATE: If you think it should work and it continues to cause problems, use the windows solution (i.e. reboot everything) and do a clean build. Here is a more current <a href="http://www.24100.net/2009/02/iphone-sdk-mobile-provisioning-0xe800003a-0xe8000001/">discussion</a>.</em>

As many developers have figured out by now, iPhone code signing is unnecessarily difficult. To make matters worse, it doesn&#8217;t sound like Apple is very responsive to their developers. (In my case they have yet to get back to me after two days.) A couple of key points:
<ol>
	<li>In the main XCode screen, highlight Targets-&gt;AppName, and click the info button. Under Build, the &#8220;Code Signing Identity&#8221; must <em>exactly</em> match the certificate name from the certificate manager.An Open Question: Does this value get inherited from the project values?</li>
	<li>The Resources-&gt;info.plist file must have the correct app id. In my case
com.tomwhipple.${PRODUCT_NAME:identifier}</li>
</ol>
A couple of more detailed discussions:

  <div class="entry-content">This year the fires are hitting a little closer to home. (Fortunately, everything seems to be OK so far.) A couple weeks ago there was a <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/oct/12/fire-burns-7-acres-in-ventura-river-bed/">fire in the Ventura River bottom</a>. Today, a <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/oct/22/small-fire-ventura/">more serious fire</a> started on the edge of town and moved up into the hills. The entire hillside burned, but by the time I saw it, it was just a black hill with a bit of smoke coming off. It must have gone over the ridge, since helicopters were dropping water there. (I can still hear them as I write this.) But there wasn&#8217;t much smoke coming from the area. It looks like the wind has died for the evening, so I would be surprised if it flares up again.

But, it looks like a bigger fire must have started up the coast towards Santa Barbra, because there is a lot of smoke blowing out to sea from much farther west.

I took a picture of the sunset and smoke with my iPhone, but can&#8217;t seem to get it off the phone without a lot of extra hassle. (Apple has been a big disappointment lately, but that&#8217;s another story.)

  <div class="entry-content"><em>UPDATE: It seems that most of the nonsense described below is fixed in XCode 3.1.2. However it is still necessary to import the project and then check it out again.</em>

Apple ostensibly has integrated CVS &amp; SVN as version control into XCode. But in XCode 3.1.1 the CVS integration is very poor. The problem seems to be the project/build directory where XCode keeps binaries. This directory appears to be generated from all the other files, so the solution seems to be to leave it out of CVS.

These steps seem to work:
<ol>
	<li>Make sure the repository is set up. (See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/cvsoverview.html">Apple&#8217;s instructions</a> or better yet, the <a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/">CVS manual</a>) This includes defining the repository under SCM in XCode.</li>
	<li>Create the project in a temporary directory as normal in XCode.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>SCM&gt;Configure SCM for this project</strong>. Choose your repository and click OK.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Build&gt;Clean All Targets</strong>.</li>
	<li>Close the project window.</li>
	<li>Go to the project directory in the Finder and delete the contents of the &#8220;build&#8221; directory.</li>
	<li>In XCode, go to <strong>SCM&gt;Repositories</strong> tool.</li>
	<li>Click &#8220;Import&#8221; and import the temporary project directory into CVS.</li>
	<li>Click &#8220;Checkout&#8221; and choose the directory where you will do your work. (This is NOT the temporary project directory you created in step 2.)</li>
	<li>XCode will ask you if you want to open the project when it is done with the checkout. If the checkout directory structure looks good, you should delete the temporary directory.</li>
</ol>
NOTE: If some subset of the builds directory shows up under the SCM tool on the left of the project tab, go to <strong>SCM&gt;Refresh Entire Project </strong>BEFORE the build directory gets committed.
NOTE 2: If the build directory gets committed by mistake, delete it from the repository, the local directory structure, and the corresponding entry in the projectdir/CVS/Entries file.

  <div class="entry-content">The stock market has lost something like 10% in a SINGLE DAY. All because the congress couldn&#8217;t figure out what the hell they are doing. Rather than waiting and forming a stable consensus, they brought the bill to a vote and <em>let it fail</em>. In doing so they have failed the country. All 435 members of the house share in this responsibility equally. If they voted for it, they failed to do enough to build consensus with their colleagues. If they voted against it, they need to explain to the country why they didn&#8217;t raise the objection before.

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever done it before, but I wrote my congressman (R-CA) about it:
<blockquote>I see from your website that you voted against today&#8217;s financial bailout bill. As a result of your action, the stock market has declined dramatically. We have been hearing from various experts for the past several days that the situation is very bad, yet you have ignored this advice and contributed to an escalation of the problem.

You are therefore personally responsible for the decline in the market. Allowing such an important bill to fail is irresponsible. As a member of congress, you are part of a very small group of national leaders. Safeguarding the health of our economy is just as important as protecting our physical security. It is part of your responsibility as a leader and duty as an American to put politics and ideology aside in this time of crisis and figure out a way out of this situation.

If you and your colleagues cannot support the bill as proposed, you must work together to come up with a reasonable solution, before it is put to a vote. We saw the result of this failure in the market today. You are all, Democrat and Republican, equally responsible for this result. Each one of you owes the country and your constituents a detailed explanation of your position and reasoning.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">So far, the new iPhone software released on Friday doesn&#8217;t look good. I&#8217;ve had two problems in as many days.

Yesterday, the bluetooth headset did not deactivate after a call ended until after I unlocked the phone with the slider dodad.

But the worst happened today. I was driving down the PCH enjoying the day and a listening to a podcast when my phone decided to stop playing the podcast and dial a friend. At first I thought he was calling me, but after an awkward confused silence I realized what had happened. Needless to say, this is very bizarre and totally unacceptable. Imagine being in the middle of a personal conversation when your phone decides to call a random contact!!

So, 2.0.1 is still looking pretty good.

  <div class="entry-content">&#8230; and if you do, don&#8217;t upgrade to 2.0.2 if you can help it.

I upgraded to the 3G about 2 weeks before 2.0.2 was released, then upgraded the software shortly after it was available, so I don&#8217;t know which to blame for the problems I have.

In addition to the 3G call dropping and other issues that seem to be more AT&amp;T&#8217;s problem than Apple&#8217;s, there are major problems with the stability of the software. It hangs unexpectedly at inconvenient times, and apps seem to crash with alarming frequency. We have come to count on Apple for products that &#8220;just work&#8221; but this version seems to break that confidence. A couple of examples: The SMS application seems to take <em>forever</em> to load (ok it&#8217;s just a few seconds, but enough time to be annoying). The contact manager seems to suffer from the same problem, plus it can stop responding and hang for several seconds instead of scrolling through the contacts as expected. Other built in apps (such as Safari) seem to have the same problem. In a final bit of irony, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">www.apple.com</a> is almost impossible to use from the iPhone (good luck trying to find an Apple store on the iPhone).

One begins to wonder what is going on over at Apple. If their product is going to live up to its promise, these bugs <em>must</em> be fixed. If not, Apple is going to lose its position in the phone market to cheaper competitors that are just as buggy, in the same way that Apple gave up the OS market to Microsoft; a crappy but cheaper system winning out over a better designed but somewhat behind the curve OS + hardware combination.

So, I would go back to 1st generation iPhone if I could, but the screen is cracked so that isn&#8217;t really an option.
