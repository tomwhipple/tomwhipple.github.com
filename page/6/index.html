  <div class="entry-content"><em>UPDATE: It seems that most of the nonsense described below is fixed in XCode 3.1.2. However it is still necessary to import the project and then check it out again.</em>

Apple ostensibly has integrated CVS &amp; SVN as version control into XCode. But in XCode 3.1.1 the CVS integration is very poor. The problem seems to be the project/build directory where XCode keeps binaries. This directory appears to be generated from all the other files, so the solution seems to be to leave it out of CVS.

These steps seem to work:
<ol>
	<li>Make sure the repository is set up. (See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/cvsoverview.html">Apple&#8217;s instructions</a> or better yet, the <a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/">CVS manual</a>) This includes defining the repository under SCM in XCode.</li>
	<li>Create the project in a temporary directory as normal in XCode.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>SCM&gt;Configure SCM for this project</strong>. Choose your repository and click OK.</li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Build&gt;Clean All Targets</strong>.</li>
	<li>Close the project window.</li>
	<li>Go to the project directory in the Finder and delete the contents of the &#8220;build&#8221; directory.</li>
	<li>In XCode, go to <strong>SCM&gt;Repositories</strong> tool.</li>
	<li>Click &#8220;Import&#8221; and import the temporary project directory into CVS.</li>
	<li>Click &#8220;Checkout&#8221; and choose the directory where you will do your work. (This is NOT the temporary project directory you created in step 2.)</li>
	<li>XCode will ask you if you want to open the project when it is done with the checkout. If the checkout directory structure looks good, you should delete the temporary directory.</li>
</ol>
NOTE: If some subset of the builds directory shows up under the SCM tool on the left of the project tab, go to <strong>SCM&gt;Refresh Entire Project </strong>BEFORE the build directory gets committed.
NOTE 2: If the build directory gets committed by mistake, delete it from the repository, the local directory structure, and the corresponding entry in the projectdir/CVS/Entries file.

  <div class="entry-content">The stock market has lost something like 10% in a SINGLE DAY. All because the congress couldn&#8217;t figure out what the hell they are doing. Rather than waiting and forming a stable consensus, they brought the bill to a vote and <em>let it fail</em>. In doing so they have failed the country. All 435 members of the house share in this responsibility equally. If they voted for it, they failed to do enough to build consensus with their colleagues. If they voted against it, they need to explain to the country why they didn&#8217;t raise the objection before.

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever done it before, but I wrote my congressman (R-CA) about it:
<blockquote>I see from your website that you voted against today&#8217;s financial bailout bill. As a result of your action, the stock market has declined dramatically. We have been hearing from various experts for the past several days that the situation is very bad, yet you have ignored this advice and contributed to an escalation of the problem.

You are therefore personally responsible for the decline in the market. Allowing such an important bill to fail is irresponsible. As a member of congress, you are part of a very small group of national leaders. Safeguarding the health of our economy is just as important as protecting our physical security. It is part of your responsibility as a leader and duty as an American to put politics and ideology aside in this time of crisis and figure out a way out of this situation.

If you and your colleagues cannot support the bill as proposed, you must work together to come up with a reasonable solution, before it is put to a vote. We saw the result of this failure in the market today. You are all, Democrat and Republican, equally responsible for this result. Each one of you owes the country and your constituents a detailed explanation of your position and reasoning.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">So far, the new iPhone software released on Friday doesn&#8217;t look good. I&#8217;ve had two problems in as many days.

Yesterday, the bluetooth headset did not deactivate after a call ended until after I unlocked the phone with the slider dodad.

But the worst happened today. I was driving down the PCH enjoying the day and a listening to a podcast when my phone decided to stop playing the podcast and dial a friend. At first I thought he was calling me, but after an awkward confused silence I realized what had happened. Needless to say, this is very bizarre and totally unacceptable. Imagine being in the middle of a personal conversation when your phone decides to call a random contact!!

So, 2.0.1 is still looking pretty good.
