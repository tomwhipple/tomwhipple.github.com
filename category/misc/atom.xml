    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, here are some dos &amp; don'ts for all you recruiters out there:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>DON'T cold call me just because I've just connected with someone you know on LinkedIn.</strong></li>
    <li>DON'T pretend that I should know who you are. - If you've never spoken to me before, an introduction is appropriate.</li>
    <li>DON'T just use random keywords from my blog and profile and assume they define me. Just because I've written about an SEO talk I went to two years ago doesn't mean that I do SEO a living. (Hint: My resume &amp; profile talk about software development. SEO is <em>not</em> software development).</li>
    <li>DON'T just pass on my name and number to a co-worker without any context.</li>
    <li>DO <em>email</em> me with an introduction and specific details and, if you must call, ask for a good  time to do so.</li>
    <li>DO know who I am and what I do <em>before</em> you call.</li>
    <li>DO understand that my time is valuable and that, as a contractor,Â  I'm losing money if I'm talking to you.</li>
</ul>


<p>(And in case you are thinking about contacting me, I'm not looking for new opportunities at the moment.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year the fires are hitting a little closer to home. (Fortunately, everything seems to be OK so far.) A couple weeks ago there was a <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/oct/12/fire-burns-7-acres-in-ventura-river-bed/">fire in the Ventura River bottom</a>. Today, a <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/oct/22/small-fire-ventura/">more serious fire</a> started on the edge of town and moved up into the hills. The entire hillside burned, but by the time I saw it, it was just a black hill with a bit of smoke coming off. It must have gone over the ridge, since helicopters were dropping water there. (I can still hear them as I write this.) But there wasn't much smoke coming from the area. It looks like the wind has died for the evening, so I would be surprised if it flares up again.</p>

<p>But, it looks like a bigger fire must have started up the coast towards Santa Barbra, because there is a lot of smoke blowing out to sea from much farther west.</p>

<p>I took a picture of the sunset and smoke with my iPhone, but can't seem to get it off the phone without a lot of extra hassle. (Apple has been a big disappointment lately, but that's another story.)</p>

<p>What??</p>

<p>Isn't it just easier to say "KEEP OUT" or "NO TRESPASSING"?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>But, I'm still alive.</p>

<p>After my own server died a few months ago, I finally have my website moved over to laughingsquid.net. As far as I can tell everything is now back up and running.</p>

<p align="center"> <a href="http://www.laughingsquid.com"><img src="http://www.laughingsquid.net/images/powered_white.gif" alt="Powered by Laughing Squid" width="150" height="50" border="0" /></a></p>


<p>Most of the outage has been due to my own laziness. I haven't been motivated to keep the site up lately. But, Laughing Squid seems to have very responsive servers, which is far more than I can say about godaddy.com.</p>
