<p>Last night I learned that <a href="http://www.walki-talki.com">walki-talki.com</a>'s walking tour of London was just approved by Apple for release and <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320626439&amp;mt=8&amp;s=143441">posted to the App Store</a>. I won't re-post all of the details (<a href="http://walki-talki.com/wordpress/2009/07/04/walki-talki-releases-london-tour-for-the-iphone/">you can check them out here</a>). But I will say that it's about time!! Apple has taken nearly 2 weeks to approve this app, but has not yet approved our Amsterdam tour, despite it being submitted a month earlier! Anyway, enough griping. We are very pleased to be making progress.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The party last night was great! Cake (the band, not the food) played for us for a little more than an hour. I took some pictures, but iPhoto is crashing when I try to download them. (Hey Apple, what's up with that?) It was a true geek party in that the ratio of men to women was about 100:1. One woman actually took a picture of the huge line for the men's room. (Needless to say, there were no lines for the women's.)</p>

<p>This morning I focused on fixing bugs in our app, both serious and trivial. I got some great advice on how to properly design the internals of the application to take full advantage of Apple's architecture. The Apple engineers have been an enormously valuable source of information from quick tips &amp; tricks to detailed answers.</p>

<p>Today's lunchtime speaker was Neil Young (no, not the singer), CEO of <a href="http://blog.ngmoco.com/">Ngmoco</a>. This company was founded in March 2008, as a direct result of the release of the iPhoneOS 2.0, SDK &amp; App Store. It was interesting to hear how quickly they were able to put the whole thing together and begin earning revenue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow. We covered a lot of good material today. From advanced debugging techniques to recommendations for best practices in app design it was all very helpful, though again quite boring to a non-developer audience.</p>

<p>The lunchtime talk was about a <a href="http://www.moonviews.com/">techno-archeology project</a> is using Macs to reconstruct moon image data from original NASA analog recordings. The central problem they experienced is that although the media is in good shape, there were no tape machines capable of reading it! Fortunately a couple of units were found in storage on military facilities and were able to be rebuilt for the task.</p>

<p>I'll keep this one short as the next presentation is starting now. After this it's party time!!</p>

    <updated>2009-06-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://tomwhipple.com/2009/06/wwdc-day-3-geek-details-iphone-orchestra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today brought a lot of technical details which were important but very boring to the casual audience. I spent a good chunk of time in the iPhone lab, talking to Apple engineers and others while fixing bugs in our app. Plus, one of the sessions gave me a bunch of ideas to improve the performance and look of the app. Hopefully we can start getting them approved very soon!</p>

<p>The highlight of the day from a theatrical perspective was the lunchtime talk given by Dr. Ge Wang, CTO of <a href="http://www.smule.com/">Smule</a>. The apps produced by Smule are audio related, from the sonic lighter (a flame that you can blow out by blowing on the iPhone microphone) to various instruments that are played by pressing various "holes" or sliders on the iPhone screen and blowing into the microphone. There are a lot of other neat features, like being able to hear &amp; see music played by others across the world, but I won't go into all the details.</p>

<p>The interesting part of this story is that in less than a year, one of their apps was downloaded over one million times. At $0.99 each, less 30% to Apple, that works out to be $700,000 from a single app. Not too bad for a company that didn't exist a year ago. So, it seems clear that if you can produce a compelling app, there is money to be made. The question is then what makes a compelling app. Clearly a flame that "burns" on the screen has no useful value, yet many people paid for it. Of course most in the audience were no doubt thinking along the same line.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we were treated to a performance by the Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra (or MoPho). It was ... interesting. I took some photos, but they are unbelievably bad. Perhaps if I had an iPhone 3GS they would have turned out.</p>
